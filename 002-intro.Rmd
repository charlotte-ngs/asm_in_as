# Introduction {#intro}
The use of statistical methods to analyse data from agriculture and biology increased tremendeously over the past decades. This development was put forward by the availablity of cheap computing resources. Furthermore, a number of statistical software systems have become available to help scientists and practioners to analyse their own data. An important pre-requisite for the use of such statistical software systems is a good understanding of the methods that are offered by the systems used to produce the scientific results from the analysed data. This understanding is best obtained during education of students. Hence, as teachers it is important to hand over the most important insights into statistical data analysis to students of all levels.

This book offers a collection of topics that are identified as being important to understand the data analyses that are down nowadays in livestock research and industry. For reasons of space, some of the older methods had to be left out. The depth of the covered material had to be limited, but where necessary references to more material have been added.
