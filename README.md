This book grew out of a collection of lecture notes that are used to teach a few courses in the area of livestock breeding, genomics and applied statistical methods in animal science. The advantage of having all the material in one place is to be more flexible in providing the students the appropriate choice of study material when teaching in front of a class with students having very diverse backgrounds. With this book students should be able to catch up and repeat different topics, as they require it for their own needs.
